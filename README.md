# Hi, I'm Tariq! 👋

🔥 Coding isn't just a job—it's a puzzle I solve with passion.

I'm a Software Engineer who thrives on transforming complex problems into elegant, scalable solutions. My journey into tech began with a spark of curiosity during my rigorous training at ALX Software Engineering (inspired by Holberton School), where late-night coding sessions and collaborative projects taught me the art of resilience and the thrill of seeing lines of code come to life.

## About Me

### What Drives Me 🚀
- **Building Impact**: Led a 4-member team to create a food delivery platform that slashed operational bottlenecks by 60%
- **Solving Smarter**: Designed web scrapers that turned chaotic data streams into actionable insights
- **Mastering the Stack**: From architecting APIs in Python/Flask to optimizing databases in MySQL

### Beyond the Screen 💡
- When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll find me exploring open-source projects or diving into tech meetups
- First "Hello, World!" moment in C felt like unlocking a superpower—and I've been chasing that high ever since
- Combining agile methodologies with a knack for breaking down problems into bite-sized wins

### Currently 🌱
- Creating Full Stack Web App
- Exploring the ins and outs of React and Redux for dynamic front-end experiences
- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express
- Diving into database management with MongoDB and SQL
