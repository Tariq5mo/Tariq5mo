# Hi, I'm Tariq! üëã

üî• Coding isn't just a job‚Äîit's a puzzle I solve with passion.

I'm a Software Engineer who thrives on transforming complex problems into elegant, scalable solutions. My journey into tech began with a spark of curiosity during my rigorous training at ALX Software Engineering (inspired by Holberton School), where late-night coding sessions and collaborative projects taught me the art of resilience and the thrill of seeing lines of code come to life.
